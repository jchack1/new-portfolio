                    <h2>Purpose of the project</h2>

                    <p>I built this timer because it was something I wanted to use personally.  I often noticed that I had poor posture while sitting at my desk, and I needed reminders to correct it throughout the day. It made sense to set a timer to remind myself, but I didn’t want to always set the same time interval, because that could become too predictable.</p>

                    <p>None of the timers I use regularly have a random functionality, so I decided to create one.  The user can set a range of values and the timer will calculate a random number of minutes in between those values.  The user can choose to view the time remaining as it counts down, or leave it hidden.</p>


                    
                    <hr class="hr-style"></hr>

                    <h2>Design</h2>


                    <p>Since development of the app was relatively straight-foward, I wanted to challenge myself a bit more with the visual design.  I am usually a fan of minimal, clean design, but an aesthetic I was intrigued by was vaporwave.  </p>

                    <p>Vaporwave would be difficult to sum up here succinctly. For our purposes, vaporwave is a music sub-genre and art style that hit its peak popularity in the 2010s.  It evokes nostalgia for 80s and 90s pop culture and the early internet age.  Visually, it’s a chaotic cyberpunk mash-up of pastel colours (often pink and blue), mountains, sunsets, palm trees, grids, vintage computer graphics and so much more. Today a google image search returns the examples below:</p>



                    <img src="../assets/images/random-timer/vaporwave-google-search.JPG" alt="google image search of vaporwave style" class="timer-center-img"/>

                    <p>There was a lot to work with, so I started with the elements I liked and tried to keep the chaos at a minimum.</p>

                    <p>I started with a pink and blue gradient in the background, with a small amount of transparency. </p>

                    <div class="project-ind-content">
                       
                        <div class="project-ind-paragraphs timer-row-paragraph">
                            <p >Next I created a warped grid SVG using Adobe Illustrator.  The grid was transformed to give the illusion of one-point-perspective, since this is featured in a lot of vaporwave art; it was then layered behind the transparent gradient.  </p>
                            
                        </div>

                        <img src="../assets/images/random-timer/grid-black.JPG" alt="plain grid in black" class="timer-row-img">

                    </div>

                    <div class="project-ind-content column-reverse">
                        

                        <img src="../assets/images/random-timer/timer-background.JPG" alt="app background with gradient, grid, and mountains" class="timer-row-img"/>
                       
                        <div class="project-ind-paragraphs timer-row-paragraph">
                            <p>
                                On large screen sizes a viewer may notice that the grid doesn’t cover the whole screen.  I would usually prefer to have SVGs cover the whole background, but in this case it fits well with the vaporwave aesthetic, where grids will often not cover the whole design. 
                            </p>

                            <p>An image of a mountain sunset (from Unsplash) was placed behind the grid, and these layers blended together to create a unique, vaporwave inspired look.</p>
                            
                            
                        </div>

                       

                    </div>

                   


                        
                    <div class="project-ind-content">
                        
                       
                        <div class="project-ind-paragraphs timer-row-paragraph">
                            <p>
                                Next, the html elements needed to be styled.  The buttons were given hard lines and shadows inspired by old-school computer graphics, and primary buttons were filled with a deep yellow to form a triad with the pink and blue background.  
                            </p>

                            <p>There are a variety of fonts used in vaporwave.  For the main title I used a retro font reminiscent of early arcade games, to complement the style of the buttons.  To balance out the design and minimize clutter, the rest of the text was given a sans-serif font, and the inputs are simple white boxes.</p>
                            
                            
                        </div>
