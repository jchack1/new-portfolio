                    <h2>Example jekyll post</h2>
                    <h3>December 11, 2019</h3>
                    <p>Update - I got the theme to work! In our assignment guidelines we were told to choose from one of the github pages themes. I found that I didn't particularly like most of the themes, especially as a design person. They were just not my style. I chose the "minimal" theme and I decided I would just try to customize it more to my liking. </p>

                    <p>I struggled in class this week to get a theme to work. I suppose that is just because I didn't know what I was doing yet. I must have been missing some critical yet small piece to the puzzle. Today I tried this strategy and had success:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>set up my site folder with a few pages, posts, layouts, navigation, and data</li>
                        <li>download the theme folder from github onto my machine</li>
                        <li>copied files one by one into my site folder, being careful about which ones I wanted to replace</li>
                        <li>made sure the gem file and config file were from the minimal theme</li>
                        <li>used command "bundle install"</li>
                        <li>then command "bundle exec jekyll serve"</li>
                        <li>realized that I needed the minimal layouts in my site folder, made a few changes to my pages</li>
                        <li>now I am seeing my pages, with the minimal theme. Yay!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Another example jekyll post</h2>
                    <h3>December 10, 2019</h3>
                    <p>I just saved my post, and used the command "bundle exec jekyll serve" to start serving my site to localhost:4000. It appears that my posts are showing up on this page and working as expected. Once I have more posts created I will consider creating categories. </p>

                    <p>As of right now I think I would like to "live blog" my experience creating this site, if you will. I cannot find the instructions for what the content of the posts should be, but I think as long as it is my own content it should be fine. If I have other content relating to art, photography, or other things,I can make categories for those things, and set it up so I have pages that display the posts from these categories only. </p>

                    <h2>First post</h2>
                    <h3>December 9, 2019</h3>
                    
                    <p>Hello, there! As you can tell from the title, this is the first post on my portfolio blog.  Ideally I would like to write blog posts as I continue learning web development.</p>

                    <p>We'll have to see if I actually keep this up. I blogged while creating my jekyll site as I was building it, and I found it was a fun process. I enjoyed writing about the successes and failures I was experiencing while building my site, and I actually went back to read previous posts to see my process and remember some of the things I tried. I would like to do this while I continue to learn, because I know I have so much left to learn. Perhaps my posts may be useful to someone else in the future. If nothing else, hopefully they will allow me to see how far I have come since starting in this field.</p>

                    <p>I feel as though a static site like I currently have is not the best way to deal with blog posts. I am debating creating a back-end with node.js. This may work better for blogs as I can use javascript on ejs pages, or something similar. Also, having to go in and update every single nav or footer whenever I make a change is a pain. So I think making a back-end will be important.</p>

                    <p>Anyway, that's it. Right now I think I will fill this up with a few more posts from my jekyll site, just to add some content.</p>
