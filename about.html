                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p><img src="assets/images/julia-photo.jpg" alt="julia photo" id="julia-photo">I come from a varied background and I have many different interests. My curiosity for science led me to study at the University of Calgary and earn a Bachelor of Science degree. After focusing on science for the first two years, I found that I missed doing creative work, as I grew up drawing, painting, and taking art classes. I decided to pursue a minor in art. This was the best decision I could have made, as it gave my program balance and revived a passion for creativity that I had lost for a while. I found a community within my printmaking courses. Sometimes I found it difficult to bring together the two fields I enjoyed, and I frequently explored these ideas in my printmaking and photography work.</p>

                <p>After graduation I spent a few years working administrative jobs at a local credit union. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of this work and feeling like the branch detective. I knew that going forward I wanted to pursue a career that would challenge my mind and problem-solving skills, as well as combine my analytical and creative sides.  Web development was the perfect combination of my interests, so I attended the Web Developer program at SAIT to further my skills. During these early years I was amazed by what I could create with code; it still feels magical to see my code translated into a beautiful UI or help accomplish a useful backend task.</p>

                <p>Since completing my program I have worked in the industry as a full stack developer, specializing mainly in React, Node, and AWS.  I have worked and volunteered with small development teams, but for much of that time I worked as a solo developer for a start-up.  I had to wear many hats, designing and developing new features from concept to completion, with minimal technical help. </p> 

                <p>I am excited to continue learning and growing my skills, and am always open to new challenging opportunities.  </p>
